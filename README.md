A creative and dependable front-end web developer with a great work ethic, and proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript [Angular framework, TypeScript] and WordPress theme and plugins development. Currently in transition to become a full stack developer using the MEAN stack but I have yet to develop a real-world problem-solving project with it. Over the past two years I was developing website and dynamic web applications by integrating user experience principles and optimizing them to increase traffic of web visitors.

Currently I have started a small design agency which provides small businesses with creative strategies and design collaterals that connects them with their ideal customers.
